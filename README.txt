So the game has 2 tile generators the first one is written in JS as it was from the book. The second one is a port to c#. 
They both work and you can select which one to use in Unity under the tileGenerator object in the hierarchy view. 
The timing on the C# script needs to be fixed as well as both scripts have a nasty bug if you don't first click on a tile. 
This needs to be further investigated.
